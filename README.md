# Smart Home Simulator (Java OOP Project with GUI Option)

This repository contains a Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project that simulates a smart home environment. It includes various smart devices that consume energy and renewable energy sources that generate it. The simulator calculates energy consumption, renewable energy generation, and the overall cost based on a set electricity price. This version of the simulator offers both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the simulation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following Java classes:

* **`EnergyConsumer` (Abstract Class):**
    * Represents a generic energy-consuming device with common attributes like name, power consumption, and status (on/off).
    * Provides methods to turn the device on/off and calculate energy consumption.
    * Includes an abstract method `displayStatus()` to be implemented by concrete device classes.
* **`RenewableEnergySource` (Interface):**
    * Defines the contract for renewable energy sources with a `generateEnergy()` method.
* **`SmartLight` (Class):**
    * Extends `EnergyConsumer` and represents a smart light with brightness control and an optional occupancy sensor.
    * Implements methods to dim the light and overrides `turnOn()` to consider the occupancy sensor.
    * Implements `displayStatus()` to show the light's specific attributes.
* **`SmartHVAC` (Class):**
    * Extends `EnergyConsumer` and represents a smart HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) system with target temperature and fan speed control.
    * Implements methods to set target temperature and fan speed, adjusting power consumption accordingly.
    * Implements `displayStatus()` to show the HVAC's specific attributes, including current temperature.
* **`SmartRefrigerator` (Class):**
    * Extends `EnergyConsumer` and represents a smart refrigerator with internal temperature control.
    * Implements methods to set the internal temperature.
    * Implements `displayStatus()` to show the refrigerator's internal temperature.
* **`SolarPanel` (Class):**
    * Implements `RenewableEnergySource` and represents a solar panel, generating energy based on its surface area, efficiency, and sunlight intensity.
    * Includes a method to set the current sunlight intensity.
* **`WindTurbine` (Class):**
    * Implements `RenewableEnergySource` and represents a wind turbine, generating energy based on its blade diameter, efficiency, and wind speed.
    * Includes a method to set the current wind speed.
* **`SmartHomeSimulator` (Class):**
    * The core logic class that manages a list of `EnergyConsumer` devices and `RenewableEnergySource` objects.
    * Allows adding devices and renewable sources to the simulation.
    * The `simulate()` method calculates the energy consumption of all devices, the energy generated by renewable sources, and the total cost based on the provided electricity price. This class can be used by both the CLI and the GUI.
* **`SmartHomeGUI` (Class):**
    * Provides a graphical user interface for interacting with the `SmartHomeSimulator`.
    * Allows users to add and control devices, view energy consumption and generation, and set simulation parameters.
    * Utilizes Java Swing or JavaFX for creating the user interface components.
* **`SmartHomeApp` (Class):**
    * The main entry point of the application, launching the GUI.

## How to Run the Simulation

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

1.  **Ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.**
2.  **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd smart-home-simulator
    ```
4.  **Compile all Java files, including the GUI-related classes:**
    ```bash
    javac SmartHomeSimulator.java EnergyConsumer.java RenewableEnergySource.java SmartLight.java SmartHVAC.java SmartRefrigerator.java SolarPanel.java WindTurbine.java SmartHomeGUI.java SmartHomeApp.java
    ```
5.  **Run the GUI application:**
    ```bash
    java SmartHomeApp
    ```
    This command will launch the graphical user interface of the Smart Home Simulator.

## Features Demonstrated

This project demonstrates several key OOP concepts:

* **Abstraction:** The `EnergyConsumer` abstract class defines a common interface for all energy-consuming devices.
* **Inheritance:** Concrete device classes (`SmartLight`, `SmartHVAC`, `SmartRefrigerator`) inherit properties and behaviors from `EnergyConsumer` and extend them with their specific functionalities.
* **Polymorphism:** The `displayStatus()` method is overridden in each concrete device class to provide device-specific status information. The simulation logic in `SmartHomeSimulator` can work with different device types through their common interfaces.
* **Interfaces:** The `RenewableEnergySource` interface defines a contract for all renewable energy generators.
* **Encapsulation:** Class members (attributes) are typically private, and access is controlled through public methods (getters and setters), ensuring data integrity.
* **Lists and Iteration:** The `SmartHomeSimulator` uses `ArrayList` (or similar) to manage collections of devices and renewable sources and iterates through them to perform the simulation.
* **GUI Development:** Demonstrates the use of Java Swing or JavaFX to create an interactive user interface.
* **Event Handling:** The GUI utilizes event listeners to respond to user interactions (e.g., button clicks, menu selections), allowing for dynamic control of the simulation.
* **Visual Representation:** The GUI provides a visual way to interact with and monitor the smart home environment.

## Potential Enhancements

This project can be further enhanced by adding:

* More sophisticated energy consumption models for different devices.
* More diverse smart devices.
* More complex renewable energy models.
* Real-time simulation updates in the GUI.
* Data persistence to save and load simulation states and GUI configurations.
* Event-driven behavior where devices react to changes.
* Energy storage solutions.
* User customization of the smart home layout within the GUI.
* Network capabilities to simulate remote control.
