# Smart Home Simulator (Java OOP Project)

This repository contains a Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project that simulates a smart home environment. It includes various smart devices that consume energy and renewable energy sources that generate it. The simulator calculates energy consumption, renewable energy generation, and the overall cost based on a set electricity price.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following Java classes:

* **`EnergyConsumer` (Abstract Class):**
    * Represents a generic energy-consuming device with common attributes like name, power consumption, and status (on/off).
    * Provides methods to turn the device on/off and calculate energy consumption.
    * Includes an abstract method `displayStatus()` to be implemented by concrete device classes.
* **`RenewableEnergySource` (Interface):**
    * Defines the contract for renewable energy sources with a `generateEnergy()` method.
* **`SmartLight` (Class):**
    * Extends `EnergyConsumer` and represents a smart light with brightness control and an optional occupancy sensor.
    * Implements methods to dim the light and overrides `turnOn()` to consider the occupancy sensor.
    * Implements `displayStatus()` to show the light's specific attributes.
* **`SmartHVAC` (Class):**
    * Extends `EnergyConsumer` and represents a smart HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) system with target temperature and fan speed control.
    * Implements methods to set target temperature and fan speed, adjusting power consumption accordingly.
    * Implements `displayStatus()` to show the HVAC's specific attributes, including current temperature.
* **`SmartRefrigerator` (Class):**
    * Extends `EnergyConsumer` and represents a smart refrigerator with internal temperature control.
    * Implements methods to set the internal temperature.
    * Implements `displayStatus()` to show the refrigerator's internal temperature.
* **`SolarPanel` (Class):**
    * Implements `RenewableEnergySource` and represents a solar panel, generating energy based on its surface area, efficiency, and sunlight intensity.
    * Includes a method to set the current sunlight intensity.
* **`WindTurbine` (Class):**
    * Implements `RenewableEnergySource` and represents a wind turbine, generating energy based on its blade diameter, efficiency, and wind speed.
    * Includes a method to set the current wind speed.
* **`SmartHomeSimulator` (Class):**
    * The main class that manages a list of `EnergyConsumer` devices and `RenewableEnergySource` objects.
    * Allows adding devices and renewable sources to the simulation.
    * The `simulate()` method calculates the energy consumption of all devices, the energy generated by renewable sources, and the total cost based on the provided electricity price.
    * The `main()` method demonstrates the creation of devices and sources, simulates their operation over a period, and displays the results.

## How to Run the Simulation

1.  **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd smart-home-simulator
    ```
3.  **Compile the Java files:**
    ```bash
    javac SmartHomeSimulator.java EnergyConsumer.java RenewableEnergySource.java SmartLight.java SmartHVAC.java SmartRefrigerator.java SolarPanel.java WindTurbine.java
    ```
4.  **Run the `SmartHomeSimulator`:**
    ```bash
    java SmartHomeSimulator
    ```

    This will execute the simulation defined in the `main()` method, showing the energy consumption of each device, the energy generated by the renewable sources for each hour, and the final cost.

## Simulation Output Example

Below is an example of the output you might see after running the simulation:

## Features Demonstrated

This project demonstrates several key OOP concepts:

* **Abstraction:** The `EnergyConsumer` abstract class defines a common interface for all energy-consuming devices.
* **Inheritance:** Concrete device classes (`SmartLight`, `SmartHVAC`, `SmartRefrigerator`) inherit properties and behaviors from `EnergyConsumer` and extend them with their specific functionalities.
* **Polymorphism:** The `displayStatus()` method is overridden in each concrete device class to provide device-specific status information.
* **Interfaces:** The `RenewableEnergySource` interface defines a contract for all renewable energy generators.
* **Encapsulation:** Class members (attributes) are typically private, and access is controlled through public methods (getters and setters).
* **Lists and Iteration:** The `SmartHomeSimulator` uses `ArrayList` to manage collections of devices and renewable sources and iterates through them to perform the simulation.

## Potential Enhancements

This project can be further enhanced by adding:

* More sophisticated energy consumption models for different devices (e.g., non-linear power usage based on settings).
* More diverse smart devices (e.g., smart TVs, washing machines).
* More complex renewable energy models (e.g., considering weather patterns for solar and wind).
* A user interface to interact with the simulator and configure devices.
* Data persistence to save and load simulation states.
* Event-driven behavior where devices react to changes in the environment or other devices.
* Energy storage solutions (e.g., batteries).
